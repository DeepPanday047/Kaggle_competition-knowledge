This project is part of the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We are given a dataset containing tweets along with additional information such as keywords and locations.
    - We are tasked with predicting whether a tweet is about a real disaster (target=1) or not (target=0).

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
    - Load the training data (`train.csv`) and explore its structure.
    - Check for missing values in columns like `text`, `location`, and `keyword`.
    - Preprocess the text data by removing noise, special characters, and stopwords.
    - Handle missing values in `location` and `keyword` columns.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Extract features from the text data that might be useful for prediction.
    

4. **Model Selection and Training**:
    - Choose appropriate machine learning models for text classification, such as Logistic Regression.
    - Train the chosen model on the training data.

5. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Prediction and Submission**:
    - Make predictions on the test data using the trained model.
    - Format the predictions according to the sample submission file.
    - Submit the predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.

## Files
